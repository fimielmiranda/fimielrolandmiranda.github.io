<br><br><br>

When I pull up on a nigga<br>
Tell that nigga back back<br>
I'm too good with these words<br>
Watch a nigga backtrack<br>
If I die, all I know is I'm a motherfucking legend<br>
It's too late for my city<br>
I'm the youngest nigga reppin<br><br>

Oh my God, oh my God<br>
If I die, I'm a legend<br>
Oh my God, oh my God<br>
If I die, I'm a legend<br><br>

I'm up first, I'm on tour<br>
Got a girl, she from the South<br>
Used to work, used to dance in Texas<br>
Now she clean the house<br>
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about<br>
On my way, money taught me Spanish<br>
Make it andale<br>
Way up north, packed in Honda cars<br>
They 'ont know who we are<br>
Fuck em all, they only pussy niggas shooting at the star<br>
Right or wrong, I'm a write my wrongs<br>
They can't live this long<br>
You don't know where you're gonna go<br>
I got this shit mapped out strong<br><br>

When I pull up on a nigga<br>
Tell that nigga back back<br>
I'm too good with these words<br>
Watch a nigga backtrack<br>
All I know, if I die, I'm a motherfucking legend<br>
It's too late for my city<br>
I'm the youngest nigga reppin<br><br>

Oh my God, oh my God<br>
If I die, I'm a legend<br>
Oh my God, oh my God<br>
If I die, I'm a legend<br><br>

I'm the one, one<br>
Why do I feel like the only one?<br>
Why do I feel like you owe me one?<br>
6 G-O-D I'm the holy one<br>
Yeah, you know what's up<br>
They been off for a minute now<br>
You know they all sentimental now<br>
You know they all actin' different now<br>
And I, I just can't pretend<br>
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in<br>
I can't change, this shit set in stone<br>
They can't live this long<br>
You don't know where you're gonna go<br>
I got this shit mapped out strong<br><br>

When I pull up on a nigga<br>
Tell that nigga back back<br>
I'm too good with these words<br>
Watch a nigga backtrack<br>
All I know, if I die, I'm a motherfucking legend<br>
It's too late for my city<br>
I'm the youngest nigga reppin<br><br>

Oh my God, oh my God<br>
If I die, I'm a legend<br>
Oh my God, oh my God<br>
If I die, I'm a legend<br><br>

I'm the one...<br>
