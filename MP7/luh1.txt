<br><br><br>

Falling too fast <br>
Clearly rules don't apply <br>
Cant believe that I just met you <br>
You got me here watching minutes pass by <br>
Wondering when to expect you <br>
There you go is this a dream <br>
Looking like every picture that I've seen of you before <br>
Ive seen it all before now that its over <br>
Should have known better <br>
Then to think this was real <br>
And you could be mine <br>
Should have known better <br>
Slowed it down <br>
Cause I feel you needed time <br>
But I kept thinkin' <br>
This could be something [3x] <br>
This could be [2x] <br>
This could be something [3x] <br>
Maybe its just nothing at all <br>
But this could be something <br>
This could be something <br>
This could be [2x] <br>
This could be something [3x] <br>
Maybe its just nothing at all <br>
At all [2x] <br>
Maybe its just nothing at all <br>
At all [2x] <br>
I guess its what we make it [2x]<br>
