<p style="text-align:justify"> <font size="5"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I will start with telling about me that you will see in my birth of certificate. I am Miranda, Fimiel Roland I. a male. I am turning 19 years old in September 1, I was born in Pasay City, and my mother is Imelda Miranda who is married to Rolando Miranda. Now I will explain who I think I am, I think I am just a guy who wants an easy life, if I am not in school, I’m just doing computer games after doing my homework because it is my hobby since I was in elementary, I am a friendless person, I think I am a person would think that sand is called sand because it is in the middle of sea and land that is how naive I am, I think. I think I am a person who would love to not feel time I am sure that I am really lazy. I know I am irresponsible because even if there is something not organize like my clothes its disorganize I will think that I will fix it later then later i will still say to myself that I will fix it later but in real i will not even try to fix it I will just think of it. I know I am blue (sad), because I am a person who will always a mask with a smiling face on it. I am really, I mean really negative about myself because I really hate myself, some will try to cheer me up but still I don't like myself, I don't believe in me, i don't even trust myself, but still you can trust me. I’m a person that would choose death in a life or death situation but still i will try to choose life, to help my family in everyday chores in the house.

<center> <font size="12"> Education is the best investment </font size> <br> <br> </center>
<p style="text-align:justify">  <font size="5"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  For me, education is indeed the best investment a person could have, why? Because having a college degree diploma is not a piece of paper that you can have right away or buy from anywhere… No one can buy a diploma in order to be hired into a certain position in a company or institution. Having education is a thing that you invest almost half of your lifetime! Right when you are five or six years old you will start going to school until you finish your college degree. Imagine how long it takes for you to finish school, how much effort you will exert all through out, how much energy you need to use in order to get through it. You invest a lot of your lifetime studying and pursuing a course for a job that you want someday but after all of those hardships, efforts, and struggles it will be worth it after you finish your degree because you will have a diploma that is needed for you to apply and qualify for a decent job.
If you finished school and have a decent degree you will more likely to have a decent a job with a decent salary that will eventually increase if you perform well enough and guess what? Having a good salary will eventually lead you to having a good financial status that will eventually lead you to having a decent life! If you have good salary you can afford the things that you always wanted when you were still studying and buy your parents a house to thank them for everything that they sacrificed for you in order to graduate. So for me Education is basically the best investment because having a diploma would make you more likely to find a decent job! </br>
